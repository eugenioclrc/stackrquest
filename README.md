üì¶ **Stackr Hackerpack** is a collection of tools and libraries to help you build decentralized applications on the Stackr ecosystem. It includes a basic Counter micro-rollup and a companion Next.js frontend to help you get started with your project.

üõ†Ô∏è Built using Stackr's SDK, NextJS, Privy, Wagmi and Viem.

- :thought_balloon: **Opinionated APIs**: The included micro-rollup has a server exposed with some opinionated endpoints to get started easily.
- :hook: **Frontend hooks**: Hooks that makes it breezy to submit actions to Micro-rollup.
- :closed_lock_with_key: **Embedded Wallet**: We have pre-configured Privy in this example, that can be easily extended to support in-browser wallets as wells as Embedded wallets linked to other identity providers.

## Wallet Setups ‚öôÔ∏è

This repo has been setup with [Privy](https://www.privy.io/), and we have included three modes of wallet setups:
| Mode | Description | Code Branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Embedded Wallet with Custodial wallet Auth | Uses Privy's embedded wallet to sign transactions (signing pop-up can be suppressed) | [`main`](https://github.com/stackrlabs/hackerpack/) |
| Embedded Wallet with Social/Email Auth | Uses Privy's embedded wallet to sign transactions (signing pop-up can be suppressed) | [`social`](https://github.com/stackrlabs/hackerpack/tree/social) |
| Using Custodial wallet | Uses your wallet to sign transactions (requires pop-up) | [`custodial`](https://github.com/stackrlabs/hackerpack/tree/custodial) |
